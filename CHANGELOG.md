# Changelog

## 28.7.0

- Do not include categories as part of the matching_text

## 28.6.0

- Pass a proximity radius specified on an index through to coalesce
- Slightly increase the penalty for features where an address number isn't found (e.g. street fallbacks), since more of these make it into final results when address indexes have a higher proximity radius
- Use carmen-cache version 0/27.0 that specifies a distance floor

## 28.5.0

- Allow properties with an `override:<index name>` property to replace the calculated value
  that would be returned in the context array otherwise

## 28.4.3

- De-duplicate address results based on matched text and context

## 28.4.2

- Add support for Russian-style address numbers, including Korpus and Stroenie

## 28.4.1

- Fix error condition when attempting to resolve ID collisions involving intersection features

## 28.4.0

- Output `feature.geometry.intersection: true` on intersection features

## 28.3.0
- Add intersection search support which allows users to search for "Street A and Street B"

## 28.2.0

- Add a mechanism for address indexes to express their expected housenumber order (before or after the street name) and use it to rank otherwise-tied results.

## 28.1.0

- Add support for individual address properties using the `carmen:addressprops` tag

## 28.0.0

- Allow source replacements to change the ‘cardinality’ of a query, including splitting, combining and removing tokens.
- Global replacements are no longer enumerated at index time when generating index-able variants.
- Improved address number parsing, now recognizes formats like `2/3-4`
- Improved CJK numeric tokenization doesn’t stop parsing text after the first number.
- Fixed a bug where we could detect an address number early in processing but fail to locate it again before presenting results

## 27.2.0

- Sort non-interpolated address results over interpolated address results given the same relevance.

## 27.1.0

- Added support for performing autocomplete queries on partial housenumbers (e.g., querying for "51" and getting "510 Main St.") if proximity is enabled
- Moved to a new carmen-cache release (0.26.0) that generates more compact indexes in some circumstances, and supports new fast-path operations to make partial-housenumber search more performant
- Added support for indexes with index bounds that cross the antimeridian
- Refactored tokenization to logic to facilitate future feature work around cardinality-changing token replacements

## 27.0.0

## 26.1.0

- Update to carmen-cache to 0.25.0
- Tighened the width of gaussian curved use is proximity scoring by factor of 3.
- Rescaled distance and weight during proximity scoring. Previously both were put on a 1-11 scale. Now; distance is 1-10, score is 1-500.

## 25.7.2

## 25.7.1

- Fix the behavior of the geocoder_universal_text index flag so it actually skips language penalties for unviversal indexes.

## 25.7.0

- Added support for the TileJSON property `geocoder_ignore_order`. This can be used to exempt specific indexes from incurring the "backy" penalty in verifymatch, and is useful for address components whose typical written position is contra the hierarchical ordering (eg. US postcodes are typically written at the end of an address, despite not being the highest level of the US address hierarchy.

## v8.2.0
- Synonymize `carmen:text_{ISO language code}` field in indicies with `carmen:text` field to support queries in multiple languages.

## v8.0.1

- Change `geocoder_address` field to `geocoder_format` to retain ability to differentiate between address and non-address indexes.

- Update mapnik to version 3.4.3

## v6.0.1

- Use a singleton VT cache to limit memory usage across indexes.

## v6.0.0

- Switch to murmur hash and 52-bit phrase IDs.

## v5.2.2

- Triage unknown conditions that can cause an unexpected error.

## v5.2.1

- Improve `scoredist` calculation by using geometric mean of features for scaling scoredist, not max score.

## v5.2.0

- Add `types` query option to filter results by feature type.

## v5.1.2

- Fix feature id query mode.

## v5.1.1

- Smart dedupe of ghost features out of result sets when they match text of other non-ghost features.

## v5.1.0

- NumTokens V3 for more efficient feature verification. See https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/pull/310.
- Sieve indexing mode for broader indexing of feature text.
- Bumps geocoder_version to 3 (version 2 continues to be supported at runtime).

## v5.0.5

- Fix for feature verification bug where a non-optimal relevance could sometimes be assigned.

## v5.0.4

- Fix for proximity bug where extreme values would push into negative xy integers.

## v5.0.3

- Fix for decollide bug.

## v5.0.2

- Improved performance for feature verification in verifymatch.

## v5.0.1

- More efficient spatialmatch by introducing a bounds mask per index and loading grids at spatialmatch time.

## v5.0.0

- Update index format for delta encoding in carmen-cache@0.7.x. This is a breaking change that requires reindexing. See https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/pull/301 and https://github.com/mapbox/carmen-cache/pull/37 for details.

## v4.0.6

- More sophisticated tokenization behavior around punctuation -- apostraphe and period characters collapse while most others split terms.

## v4.0.5

- Doubletap - more conservative vt caching settings

## v4.0.4

- Updates to carmen-cache @ 0.6.0 for more conservative memory use
- Reduces vtile LRU cache size for high zoom sources

## v4.0.3

- Robustification fix for how token replacement handles unidecode at indexing + query time.

## v4.0.2

- Fixes to proximity mode to account for both score and distance.

## v4.0.1

- Bug fix for lone housenum subquery permutations and upgrade to carmen-cache@0.5.1.

## v4.0.0

- Large refactor of carmen index structure and indexing/runtime processes. See https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/pull/287

## v3.1.6

- Rollback XRegExp use.

## v3.1.5

- Move `addfeature.js` from test directory to lib for external testing use.

## v3.1.4

- Fix for max call stack errors when using grid indexes with high cardinality.

## v3.1.3

- Extend geocoder_tokens to use XRegExp.

## v3.1.2

- Pin to node-mapnik 3.2.x until mapnik 3.3.x is ready.

## v3.1.1

- Allow geocoder_tokens to be expressed as explicit regex patterns.

## v3.1.0

- Include ghost features if queried for explicitly.

## v3.0.9

- Proximity fixes.

## v3.0.8

- Proximity fixes.

## v3.0.7

- Prioritizes layer type + score consistently across proximity/non-proximity mode.

## v3.0.6

- Additional sort stabilization at verifymatch stage.

## v3.0.5

- Improvements to result stability in proximity mode.

## v3.0.4

- Use single closest degen for non-terminal terms.
- Update to carmen-cache@0.4.1 with support for swapped order setRelevance.

## v3.0.3

- Snap dataterm min/max values to nearest thousand. Reduces cardinality of phrase index with minimal affect on dataterm accuracy at querytime.

## v3.0.2

- Use cache#loadall when indexing.

## v3.0.1

- Added cache#loadall for loading shards without retrieving results.

## v3.0.0

- Improved suggestion/autocomplete support for partial queries.
- **Breaking change:** Introduces `dataterm` term ID type. Any carmen indexes generated previously that contained numeric text (e.g. US zipcodes or addresses with housenumbers) need to be reindexed using carmen@3.x.
